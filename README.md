# SitakuPack8s
The official modpack for 8s. Mods and configs have been and are still being extensively playtested to make sure the modpack runs well and gameplay is balanced. 
Mods and configs still WIP, but the final version of what you see here will be used in next survival world. 

# You may have noticed some mods are missing. Here're reasons for the important ones
## YUNG's mods (all five of them)
We already have three mods adding a huge variety of structures, we don't need five extra mods to do only that
## Respawning shulkers
There is a way to duplicate shulkers in vanilla mc. Also the end now has many new structures that spawn with shulkers, making them far less rare
## Radium
Doesn't work when playtesting. Replaced with rubidium extras
